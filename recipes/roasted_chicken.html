        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> 1 (3 pound) Whole Chicken, Giblets Removed </li>
                <li> Salt and Black Pepper To Taste </li>
                <li> 1 tablespoon Onion Powder, or to Taste </li>
                <li> 1/2 cup Margraine, Divided </li>
                <li> 1 stalk Celery, Leaves Removed </li>
            </ul>
        <h3> Direction </h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
                <li> Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity. </li>
                <li> Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving. </li>
            </ol>
